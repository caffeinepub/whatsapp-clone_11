  "summary": "Both REQ-9 (backend case-insensitive username uniqueness check with normalization) and REQ-10 (frontend username trimming and lowercasing before submission) are implemented in the diff. The backend introduces a usernameMap for O(1) lookups, normalizes usernames to lowercase on registration, and a migration module handles existing users. The frontend normalizes usernames in both useQueries.ts and SignupPage.tsx, validates non-empty after trimming, and preserves error messages for truly taken usernames.",

    {
      "description": "A data migration module (backend/migration.mo) was added to backfill a usernameMap from existing userAccounts for already-registered users.",
